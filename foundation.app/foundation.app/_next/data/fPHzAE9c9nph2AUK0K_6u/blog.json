If I'm living with that risk, I’d rather make art that I'm happy with. I’ve also learned not to be afraid to have a voice. Part of me still holds back very often, out of fear of public disapproval. But I had to learn to overcome that over time, through exposure. That's what being genuine is all about. Part of having a voice, or using one's own voice in an empowered way, is accepting that people might come and point something out, and they can write about it, and others can learn from it. I’ve learned that I really enjoy collaborations. I prefer working with others to working alone; I'm not so much the solo artist who just prefers to be in their studio.

Sharing one's own art involves a lot of vulnerability. It's a bit like ripping your own heart open, and you can really feel exposed. Within the industry there are so many different layers, emotionally and psychologically, where we need support. I make art both to be with people and to share it with others, and I believe that art and culture don't exist in a vacuum.
