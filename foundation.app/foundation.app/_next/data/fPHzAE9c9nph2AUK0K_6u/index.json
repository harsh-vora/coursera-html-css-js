The video discusses the collapse of old community structures, the emergence of a new community after decollectivization, Confucian obedience vs. social obedience, as well as the new tele-republic of home, ‚Äúmask politics‚Äù and social justice under the pandemic. \n\nIn Episode 6, it restores Hugh Hefner‚Äôs famous rounded bed in Chicago (which was seen as one of the oldest and most known work-from-home examples) while Macy‚Äôs version is hundreds of times more advanced technologically. Macy fits perfectly into the new type of quarantine on this bed where there‚Äôs no distance between work, pleasure, production and sex. All kinds of remote communication and electronic devices are connected through Macy‚Äôs fingertips to the new immunological community.","assetIPFSPath":"QmSEXidsDZHxDUJEtJL3W1UgHRnySYJ87soZU9kDzkTsqM/nft.glb","metadataIPFSPath":"QmRkRaZ7kJzA64P1X5dvufTyBeKXREJrxgw42QYeSi5LsQ/metadata.json","width":0,"height":0,"duration":null,"mimeType":"model/gltf-binary","mintTxHash":"0x65d4c02d2ea211222dbc9a7ea987a9f1e1387d9ddeea46c1eb2c967641dc8016","assetId":null,"assetStatus":"PENDING","status":"MINTED","hiddenAt":null,"deletedAt":null,"moderationStatus":"ACTIVE","moderationFrom":null,"latestTxDate":"2021-07-28T18:10:45","assetVersion":0},{"creator":{"id":"0x8a07ffdaf91b6344590163e4eaeb16416109e4ad","userIndex":44963,"publicKey":"0x8A07FFDaF91B6344590163e4EaEB16416109E4AD","username":"emma_stern","profileImageUrl":"https://f8n-production.s3.amazonaws.com/creators/profile/9abmheiw6-pmam1-jpg-81bdrn.jpg","coverImageUrl":"https://f8n-production.s3.amazonaws.com/creators/profile/xufyd9x26-screen-shot-2017-07-18-at-2-03-17-am-png-orgodx.png","name":"emma stern","bio":"Emma Stern 's work deploys her formal background in traditional oil-on-canvas painting to achieve a kind of contemporary portraiture made possible by 3d software.","isApprovedCreator":true,"moderationStatus":"ACTIVE","joinedWaitlistAt":"2021-04-12T17:14:49.176","createdAt":"2021-04-12T17:07:50.757441","migratedToUser":null,"isApprovedForMigrationAt":null,"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"isAdmin":false,"links":{"tiktok":{"handle":"","platform":"tiktok"},"twitch":{"handle":"","platform":"twitch"},"discord":{"handle":"","platform":"discord"},"twitter":{"handle":"","platform":"twitter"},"website":{"handle":"www.emmatstern.com","platform":"website"},"youtube":{"handle":"","platform":"youtube"},"facebook":{"handle":"","platform":"facebook"},"snapchat":{"handle":"","platform":"snapchat"},"instagram":{"handle":"lava_baby","platform":"instagram"}},"account":{"id":"0x8a07ffdaf91b6344590163e4eaeb16416109e4ad","userIndex":44963,"publicKey":"0x8A07FFDaF91B6344590163e4EaEB16416109E4AD","username":"emma_stern","profileImageUrl":"https://f8n-production.s3.amazonaws.com/creators/profile/9abmheiw6-pmam1-jpg-81bdrn.jpg","coverImageUrl":"https://f8n-production.s3.amazonaws.com/creators/profile/xufyd9x26-screen-shot-2017-07-18-at-2-03-17-am-png-orgodx.png","name":"emma stern","bio":"Emma Stern 's work deploys her formal background in traditional oil-on-canvas painting to achieve a kind of contemporary portraiture made possible by 3d software.","isApprovedCreator":true,"moderationStatus":"ACTIVE","joinedWaitlistAt":"2021-04-12T17:14:49.176","createdAt":"2021-04-12T17:07:50.757441","migratedToUser":null,"isApprovedForMigrationAt":null,"firstName":null,"lastName":null,"isAdmin":false,"links":{"tiktok":{"handle":"","platform":"tiktok"},"twitch":{"handle":"","platform":"twitch"},"discord":{"handle":"","platform":"discord"},"twitter":{"handle":"","platform":"twitter"},"website":{"handle":"www.emmatstern.com","platform":"website"},"youtube":{"handle":"","platform":"youtube"},"facebook":{"handle":"","platform":"facebook"},"snapchat":{"handle":"","platform":"snapchat"},"instagram":{"handle":"lava_baby","platform":"instagram"}}}},"dateMinted":"1627485444","id":"0x3b3ee1931dc30c1957379fac9aba94d1c48a5405-65408","mostRecentActiveAuction":{"auctionId":"66064","dateCreated":"1627494989","dateEnding":null,"dateStarted":null,"duration":"86400","highestBid":null,"id":"0xcda72070e455bb31c7690a170224ce43623d0b6f-66064","reservePriceInETH":"1","seller":{"id":"0x8a07ffdaf91b6344590163e4eaeb16416109e4ad"},"status":"Open","transactionHashCreated":"0xd68ce955952e1b411258ad1ef4997177be194d899c0712b5709cfaf0644ce006"},"nftHistory":[{"event":"Listed"},{"event":"Minted"}],"ownedOrListedBy":{"id":"0x8a07ffdaf91b6344590163e4eaeb16416109e4ad"},"tokenId":"65408","name":"Gabbi (flexing) 2 - rose gold","description":"'Gabbi (flexing) 2' is a variation of a custom-built 3d avatar which I created as a reference for a physical painting of the same title in 2020.

If I'm living with that risk, I‚Äôd rather make art that I'm happy with. I‚Äôve also learned not to be afraid to have a voice. Part of me still holds back very often, out of fear of public disapproval. But I had to learn to overcome that over time, through exposure. That's what being genuine is all about. Part of having a voice, or using one's own voice in an empowered way, is accepting that people might come and point something out, and they can write about it, and others can learn from it. I‚Äôve learned that I really enjoy collaborations. I prefer working with others to working alone; I'm not so much the solo artist who just prefers to be in their studio.

Sharing one's own art involves a lot of vulnerability. It's a bit like ripping your own heart open, and you can really feel exposed. Within the industry there are so many different layers, emotionally and psychologically, where we need support. I make art both to be with people and to share it with others, and I believe that art and culture don't exist in a vacuum.
